We describe their syntax, usage, etc.</p><p>The data structures, embedded in the image metadata, are the franca-lingua between differing implementations of this specification.</p><p>All assertions documented here shall be serialized as CBOR, and their schemas shall be defined using CDDL. More information about CBOR and how C2PA attestations are defined can be found in <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">C2PA&#39;s official standard specification.</a></p><p><strong>We will use terms which are C2PA-specific very heavily, thus we recommend that you familiarize yourself with C2PA first.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>We&#39;re in the process of overhauling the following definitions, they are still subject to change.</p></div><p><code>org.see3.attestation</code> corresponds to the ZK-based image attestation proofs that we&#39;ve described in other documentation. <code>org.see3.eq-proof</code> corresponds to the ZK-based image equivalence tech that powers our Proof of Edit.</p><p>When an <code>org.see3.attestation</code> assertion is found in the active manifest of an asset, it is immediately parsed and sent to the verifier. This will occur if an image has been proved and features no edits -- the attestation data for the asset in question should always be in the active manifest if the asset is unedited.</p><p>If no <code>org.see3.attestation</code> assertion is found, the verifier will check for an <code>org.see3.eq-proof</code>, and if one is found, the verifier will parse and verify it. This equivalence proof demonstrates that an <strong>edited image</strong>, identified by a given hash, corresponds to the <strong>original image</strong>, given the edits specified in the Edit History. This appears in the active manifest if the See3 Attestation data does NOT correspond to the current, edited version of the manifest. Instead, the See3 Attestation data will be stored in an ingredients manifest.</p><p>The <code>org.see3.eq-proof</code> which is found in the active manifest will feature an UUID which points to the next manifest. This UUID will be used to fetch the next manifest, and so on, until the UUID points to the manifest in which there is a valid <code>org.see3.attestation</code>. This allows for the chaining of edits, and the verification of the entire edit history.</p><h3 id="org-see3-attestation-and-org-see3-equals" tabindex="-1">org.see3.attestation and org.see3.equals <a class="header-anchor" href="#org-see3-attestation-and-org-see3-equals" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;org.see3.attestation and org.see3.equals&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="language-CDDL vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">CDDL</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>manifest-pointer = {</span></span>
