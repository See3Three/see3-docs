This is achieved through a combination of secure hardware environments, application integrity checks, and remote attestation procedures. These measures collectively prevent unauthorized certification of images—such as deepfakes—and ensure that only genuine photos captured by the device&#39;s camera can receive See3 Certification.</p><h3 id="enforcing-correct-application-behavior-from-the-outset" tabindex="-1">Enforcing Correct Application Behavior from the Outset <a class="header-anchor" href="#enforcing-correct-application-behavior-from-the-outset" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enforcing Correct Application Behavior from the Outset&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Binding the Cryptographic Descriptor to the Approved Application</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Application Binding</strong>: The cryptographic descriptor is tied exclusively to the approved application&#39;s unique <strong>App ID</strong>.

The combination of secure hardware, exclusive application binding, and continuous integrity checks ensures there is no feasible way for the system to misbehave or for attackers to misuse the credential. This means only authentic images captured by the camera using the approved application can receive See3 Certification, effectively preventing deepfakes and manipulated images from being falsely certified.</p><h2 id="how-do-cryptographic-descriptors-function-in-detail" tabindex="-1">How do cryptographic descriptors function in detail? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-cryptographic-descriptors-function-in-detail" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do cryptographic descriptors function in detail?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See3 means knowing that images came from real devices, without exposing the specific devices and users that took the images. We explored existing techniques for authenticating the source of data, but they weren’t privacy-preserving, couldn’t scale, or lacked essential features needed for moderation.</p><p>We created cryptographic descriptors to fill this gap.</p><h3 id="why-not-use-digital-signatures-like-c2pa" tabindex="-1">Why Not Use Digital Signatures, Like C2PA? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not-use-digital-signatures-like-c2pa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Not Use Digital Signatures, Like C2PA?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Digital signatures require you to know and trust the author&#39;s public identity (key), which isn&#39;t desirable when regulatory compliance or privacy is a concern. Attempts have been made to fix (such as key rotation), but they all depend heavily on the Certificate Authority -- a trusted entity with unchecked power to ban specific cameras or allow malicious devices to sign deepfakes. The control of CAs by large corporations and governments is deeply concerning, and gives rise to a legitimate concern these technologies will be banned in the EU.</p><p>We discuss this further in our blog, <a href="https://veracity-labs.medium.com/c2pa-is-an-american-surveillance-network-b523c5457cc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">click here to read it.</a></p><h3 id="the-advantages-of-cryptographic-descriptors-in-see3" tabindex="-1">The Advantages of Cryptographic Descriptors in See3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-advantages-of-cryptographic-descriptors-in-see3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Advantages of Cryptographic Descriptors in See3&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Cryptographic descriptors address these issues by redefining how device-related portions of metadata are authenticated. Instead of relying on individual devices to generate and sign the metadata, trust is placed in a central authority (the See3 Operator) that verifies the information associated with an image&#39;s origin and creates a reusable descriptor for it. In this case, the central authority is the See3 Operator and the author is actually the device&#39;s camera.</p><p>When a device requests a descriptor, it suggests exactly what its metadata should contain and provides evidence that this information is correct to the See3 Operator. The Operator then evaluates this information to decide whether to issue a descriptor and what content it should reference. This process is entirely programmable, enabling See3 to adapt cryptographic descriptors for various image authentication contexts.</p><p>Devices have the freedom to disclose parts of their metadata and hide others when certifying their images — only necessary information is shared. This enables verifiers to authenticate the images using valid, centrally-approved metadata without deanonymizing the specific device. This allows, for instance, verification that an image was taken by a certified See3 device without exposing the device&#39;s unique identifier.</p><h3 id="balancing-privacy-with-accountability-in-see3" tabindex="-1">Balancing Privacy With Accountability in See3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#balancing-privacy-with-accountability-in-see3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Balancing Privacy With Accountability in See3&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Cryptographic descriptors in See3 offer indistinguishability. This means that, even with multiple images certified by some cryptographic descriptor, there&#39;s no way to tell which ones came from the same device and which didn&#39;t. This level of anonymity surpasses pseudonyms such as public keys, ensuring devices can remain truly anonymous if desired.</p><p>Yet, cryptographic descriptors also address the need for holding malicious parties accountable. In situations where it&#39;s necessary — for example, for regulatory compliance — a majority of trusted moderators can work together to reveal the descriptor&#39;s unique identifier, needing only a single example of a falsely certified image.</p><p>If misuse is detected, such as a hacked device using See3 to post misleading images, the trusted moderators will recover the descriptor&#39;s identifier and use it to revoke the descriptor. This renders the cryptographic descriptor invalid — it can&#39;t be used again to certify images.</p><p>With advanced cryptographic tools, it&#39;s even possible to issue cryptographic descriptors without revealing the device&#39;s information to the See3 Operator itself. This preserves device privacy during the issuance process, making cryptographic descriptors particularly suitable for applications which require compliance with stringent data-protection regulations.</p><h3 id="it-works-offline" tabindex="-1">It Works Offline <a class="header-anchor" href="#it-works-offline" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;It Works Offline&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Cryptographic descriptors in See3 are built to function effectively both online and offline. In an online context, verifiers can quickly check the status of descriptors, ensuring they haven&#39;t been revoked. In offline scenarios, verifiers can still trust the validity of descriptors based on the last known status, thanks to timestamps included within the descriptors.</p><p>The timestamp indicates when the descriptor was last updated, providing assurance that the device was in good standing at that time. Once connectivity is restored, any updates — including revocations — can be processed to maintain overall system integrity.</p><h2 id="the-see3-trustcouncil" tabindex="-1">The See3 TrustCouncil <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-see3-trustcouncil" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The See3 TrustCouncil&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The capability to recover the device identifier from an example of an image, as well as the ability to revoke devices from a system, may be implemented using the See3 Impartial Misinformation Committee. This committee will play a crucial role in flagging misleading images and mitigating cyber-attacks which compromise legitimate devices to post fraudulent images.</p><p>By delegating the responsibility of identifying and revoking fraudulent content to an impartial committee, we ensure that accountability is maintained without compromising the privacy of honest users. This approach reconciles the need for effective content moderation with the protection of individual privacy.</p><p>We look forward to sharing further details over the coming weeks.</p>',55)]))}const g=t(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
