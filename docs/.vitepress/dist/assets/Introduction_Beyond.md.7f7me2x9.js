This is possibly inefficient, thus we are exploring a new approach which uses Group Signatures. Group Signatures have all of the same security features as our existing solutions, but are much faster to generate and verify. They&#39;re also more compact.</p><p><strong>Q: How Long Does Proof Generation and Verification Take?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Proof verification is near-instant, and attestation proof generation currently takes approximately ten seconds on a modern mid-tier laptop. Proof times will be heavily optimized in the forseeable future.</p><h2 id="roadmap" tabindex="-1">Roadmap <a class="header-anchor" href="#roadmap" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Roadmap&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We will continue to announce new tooling and solutions on a regular basis, once they have gone thorough internal testing.</p><h3 id="overcoming-the-cold-start-problem" tabindex="-1">Overcoming The Cold Start Problem <a class="header-anchor" href="#overcoming-the-cold-start-problem" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overcoming The Cold Start Problem&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We&#39;re exploring the following approaches to overcome the cold start problem:</p><ol><li><strong>Attestation Daemon</strong>: this is a tool that automatically attaches our attestation proofs to any image the user takes on their device, regardless of which app they&#39;re using to capture the image.</li><li><strong>Retrospective Edit Detection:</strong> we don&#39;t need to depend on See3-enabled editing tools -- we can guess which edits were made after the fact, and adjust the proof accordingly.</li><li><strong>Attested Image Record:</strong> we can use Retrospective Edit Detection, in combination with a database, to tell people which edited images are attested by See3, anywhere they appear on the internet.</li><li><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong> we can establish strategic partnerships with internet platforms, capture device manufacturers, and other stakeholders to introduce See3 into the user&#39;s workflow. We can also press downstream parties to adopt See3 by working with our partners to establish new financial incentives.</li><li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> we can augment existing platforms to include See3-enabled verification and editing tools using techniques such as browser plugins.</li><li><strong>Implementation Subsidies:</strong> we can subsidize the deployment and implementation of See3 across social media platforms.</li></ol><p>We look forward to announcing new solutions across all of these categories.</p><h3 id="our-distribution-model" tabindex="-1">Our Distribution Model <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-distribution-model" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Our Distribution Model&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This primarily depends a series of strategic partnerships with internet platforms, capture device manufacturers, and other stakeholders to introduce See3 into their workflows.</p><p>Among other avenues, we&#39;re exploring the following monetization paths:</p><ul><li>Authenticity APIs, which allows developers to access our bulk-verification and bulk-editing infrastructure.</li><li>Conversion APIs, which enable backwards-compatibility with other attestation products.</li><li>A Licensing Model for Trusted Parties.</li></ul><p>We will be trialing these approaches over the coming months.</p><h3 id="when-and-how" tabindex="-1">When, and How? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-and-how" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When, and How?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We recommend that you join our <a href="https://twitter.com/see3xyz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/see3isthetruth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Telegram</a> to get the latest updates and get exclusive early access to our tooling.</p>',19),i=[n];function s(l,d,h,c,p,u){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const f=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
