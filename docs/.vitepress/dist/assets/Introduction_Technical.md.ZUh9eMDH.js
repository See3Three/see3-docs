This signature implies that the image is authentic, since trusted cameras only sign what they see.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>User (Verifier)</strong> trusts the Trusted Authority, laying the foundation for a trust chain that extends from the authority, through the camera, and to the images it captures.</p></li><li><p>By verifying the links in the chain of trust, all of which are secured by cryptographic signatures, the <strong>User (Verifier)</strong> can trust the <strong>Image</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Q: Why Should The User Trust The Authority?</strong></p><p>Users should trust the authority, typically represented by camera manufacturers, for several interconnected reasons, all grounded in the structured mechanisms of the See3 ecosystem:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Community Endorsement:</strong> The authority&#39;s admission to the See3 Trust List is not arbitrary but is the result of a democratic voting process by the community of See3 token holders. This means the manufacturer&#39;s inclusion signifies a collective endorsement from an informed community, attesting to the manufacturer&#39;s credibility and the security of their devices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Incentives and Penalties:</strong> The See3 Arbitration Contract introduces significant economic incentives for manufacturers to maintain the highest security standards. Manufacturers are required to deposit USDC into the Arbitration Contract as a form of security, which can be partially or wholly slashed if their cameras are found to be compromised frequently. This financial stake motivates manufacturers to invest in advanced security measures and ensures they are directly accountable for the integrity of their products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reputation and Track Record:</strong> Beyond the immediate mechanisms of See3, the reputation and historical performance of a manufacturer play essential roles. A manufacturer with a long-standing reputation for quality and security is likely to maintain these standards to protect their market position. The track record of producing secure, reliable cameras serves as a tangible indicator of their commitment to upholding the ecosystem&#39;s integrity.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Q: Why Should The Authority Trust The Camera?</strong></p><p>The authority can trust the camera based on the security of the hardware and the rigorous testing it undergoes at the time of manufacture. Secure hardware is designed with tamper-proof and non-cloneable elements, ensuring that the camera&#39;s identity and the authenticity of its signatures can be trusted. These security measures are embedded into the hardware at a fundamental level, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to manipulate or forge the camera&#39;s outputs. Through this process, the authority establishes a high degree of confidence in the camera&#39;s ability to function as a trusted device for capturing authentic content.</p><p><strong>Q: How Do You Implement This Trust Model?</strong></p><p>We will <em>gradually</em> introduce our scheme, starting with a simple signature-only design. Whenever we introduce an approach, we will offer criticisms and potential points of improvement, before moving on to the next iteration. Through this process, we will arrive a comprehensive understanding of See3&#39;s architecture, such that the trade-offs and design choices have been carefully justified through the process of iteration.</p><h2 id="attempt-one-signature-based-attestation-ie-c2pa-s-implicit-attestation" tabindex="-1">Attempt One: Signature-Based Attestation (ie, C2PA&#39;s Implicit Attestation) <a class="header-anchor" href="#attempt-one-signature-based-attestation-ie-c2pa-s-implicit-attestation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attempt One: Signature-Based Attestation (ie, C2PA&#39;s Implicit Attestation)&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="camera-certification" tabindex="-1">Camera Certification <a class="header-anchor" href="#camera-certification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Camera Certification&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This step is necessary to establish the camera is authentic (thus honest). It involves the generation of a key-pair on the camera&#39;s secure enclave, and the signing of the camera&#39;s public key by the trusted authority.

However, if we reveal the camera&#39;s public key, it will appear on every image the camera produces. Since the key will be unique to the camera, it will be possible to associate images which originate from the same camera with each-other by merely checking that the Camera Public Key of each are the same. This is awful for user privacy.</p><h2 id="attempt-two-zk-anonymised-attestation" tabindex="-1">Attempt Two: ZK-Anonymised Attestation <a class="header-anchor" href="#attempt-two-zk-anonymised-attestation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attempt Two: ZK-Anonymised Attestation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s start with an image which is attested with a signature chain.

This undermines all cameras that use this scheme, since they can still generate valid proofs for any image, therefore undermining trust in the proofs.</p><p>For these reasons, it is desirable to add an encrypted form of the camera&#39;s public key to the metadata. This would enable us to add a camera&#39;s public key to the blacklist if it misbehaves, and to check whether the camera used to generate a given photo proof is on the blacklist. Ideally, this encrypted version should not be decryptable by malicious actors, ensuring that there is no way to de-anonymise the camera user.</p><p>The next section describes a modified version of this scheme, which introduces encrypted camera identifiers.</p><h2 id="zk-anonymised-attestation-with-encrypted-camera-identifiers-see3" tabindex="-1">ZK-Anonymised Attestation with Encrypted Camera Identifiers (See3) <a class="header-anchor" href="#zk-anonymised-attestation-with-encrypted-camera-identifiers-see3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ZK-Anonymised Attestation with Encrypted Camera Identifiers (See3)&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="proving-1" tabindex="-1">Proving <a class="header-anchor" href="#proving-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proving&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="Proving Flow"></p><p><strong>The yellow inputs are <em>private</em> inputs.

The resulting key is called the Shared Secret. <ul><li>The point of creating a shared secret is to let the Keeper know what secret key to use for decrypting the encrypted version of the Camera Public Key.</li><li>We can&#39;t attach it to the image data, since everyone would see it, so we need a way of letting the keeper calculate this decryption key in such a way that only they can figure it out.</li><li>This process is called ECDH, and it too much for us to explain here.</li></ul></li><li>We also generate a ECDH Public Key of our own, which the Keeper will need to generate the Shared Secret, so that we don&#39;t have to reveal the Shared Secret.
