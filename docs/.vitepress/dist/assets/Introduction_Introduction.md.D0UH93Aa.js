You can integrate See3 into any mobile application using our SDK, and it will work just like a normal camera app.</p><p>It works by using the existing secure-hardware capabilities of your device to show that the image was taken on a real, non-cheating camera. It&#39;s discrete too: everything the viewer needs to confirm that an image is real is stored in the image&#39;s metadata.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to change how your software works, since See3 is practically invisible and doesn&#39;t leak identifiable information by default.
