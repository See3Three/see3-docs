# Roadmap, and FAQ

## FAQ

**Q: Are ZK Proofs Necessary for See3?**

**A:** The current of iteration of See3 uses Cryptographic Descriptors, based on BBS Attribute Signatures, to prove image attestations. This is compact, fast, and most importantly, is privacy preserving.

**Q: How Long Does Proof Generation and Verification Take?**

**A:** They're instantaneous. Circa 50ms for each operation.

## Roadmap

We will continue to announce new tooling and solutions on a regular basis, once they have gone thorough internal testing.

### Overcoming The Cold Start Problem

We're exploring the following approaches to overcome the cold start problem:

1. **Retrospective Edit Detection:** we don't need to depend on See3-enabled editing tools -- we can guess which edits were made after the fact, and adjust the proof accordingly.
2. **Attested Image Record:** we can use Retrospective Edit Detection, in combination with a database, to tell people which edited images are attested by See3, anywhere they appear on the internet.
3. **Strategic Partnerships:** we can establish strategic partnerships with internet platforms, capture device manufacturers, and other stakeholders to introduce See3 into the user's workflow. We can also press downstream parties to adopt See3 by working with our partners to establish new financial incentives.
4. **Augmentation:** we can augment existing platforms to include See3-enabled verification and editing tools using techniques such as browser plugins.
5. **Implementation Subsidies:** we can subsidize the deployment and implementation of See3 across social media platforms.
6. **SVG Proof System:** we can use secure hardware in combination with the SVG file format to support the verification of edited content, supported by a cloud API for rendering edited content.

We look forward to announcing new solutions across all of these categories.

### Our Distribution Model

This primarily depends a series of strategic partnerships with internet platforms, capture device manufacturers, and other stakeholders to introduce See3 into their workflows.

Among other avenues, we're exploring the following monetization paths:

* Conversion APIs, which enable backwards-compatibility with other attestation products.
* A Licensing Model for Trusted Parties.

We will be trialing these approaches over the coming months.
