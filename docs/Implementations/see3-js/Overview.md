# see3-js

see3-js is a JavaScript library for implementing See3-compliant JavaScript applications. It supports the generation and verification of attestation proofs, as well as basic editing capabilities.

It is built on noir.js, WebWorkers, and WebAssembly.

::: danger

see3-js is still in development. It is not ready for production use, features known bugs, and is not yet fully documented. Workarounds are used heavily for the sake of the demo. The codebase is being rewritten and refactored.
